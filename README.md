## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jektify'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jektify

## Usage

To use, you need [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) installed, since [Jektify](https://github.com/jektify/jektify) is a gem for the same. You can have more information about Jektify on our [homepage](https://jektify.github.io), where you'll be detailing step by step how to use Jektyll together.

## Documentation

See: [https://jektify.github.io](https://jektify.github.io)

## Development

It all starts with:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jektify/jektify.git
$ cd jektify
```

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

*Code*

The [Jektify](https://github.com/jektify/jektify) code is stored in the folder "`lib`". Every time you change the version, it has to be changed in the file "`lib/jektify/version.rb`" respecting the version hierarchy. Files where the version should be changed:

* lib/jektify/version.rb
* bin/tests
* package.json
* gulpfile.js

*JavaScript*

[Jektify](https://github.com/jektify/jektify) uses javascript, where it is located in the folder "`src/dev/js/jektify.js`". All Javascript code must be written to it, regardless of whether it uses ES6 or not. Gem will use it in the folder "`assets/vendor/jektify/js`", and you need to minify it with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to play it there. To do this, run on the terminal in the root directory of Jektify:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

*Sass*

The layout of [Jektify](https://github.com/jektify/jektify) is being attributed by the file "`assets/vendor/jektify/sass/_jektify.scss`", in this file you should write everything stylesheets [Jektify](https://github.com/jektify/jektify) using the methodology [BEM](getbem.com).

*Pack*

Now, you can generate the gem of Jektify with the `bundle exec rake build` command, it will be bundled in the directory "`pkg`". To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
